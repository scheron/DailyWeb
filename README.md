## Concept ðŸ’¡
The whole approach originated from my need to transform my daily task tracking into something more systematic. 

I typically maintain my tasks organized by days, which allows me to revisit and track progress later. 

This stems from the standard workflow requirement: *"What I did yesterday, what I'm doing today"* ðŸ“Š
